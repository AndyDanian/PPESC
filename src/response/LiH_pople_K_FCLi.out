                    Each atom is a molecule. You can group atoms put on the same index
                    into molden file in section [Atoms], second column. Example: 

                    O 1 8 0.0 0.0 0.0
                    H 1 1 0.0 0.0 0.0
                    H 1 1 0.0 0.0 0.0

*** There are l higher p, then is neccesary re-organize mo coefficient ***
*** when is used DALTON, which will done ***
