# WRPF

Program written in Python 3.9.10 to calculate response properties in different approximations of principal propagator in No--Relativistic level

* RPA

Now, only static principal propagator and, lineal and response response

# Integrals

Integrals implemented using point nucleu, cartessian primitives and until i shell. The transformation to one or two--spherical also i shell. Also, only is considered real primitive functions (gaussian).
